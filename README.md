# Static Code Analyzer
A basic static code analyzer for Python. It can check individual or entire directories of Python files for compliance with a handful of [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidlines. Run it from the command line with ``python code-analyzer.py [file or directory]``.

Written and tested in Python 3.9. Download Python: https://python.org/downloads
